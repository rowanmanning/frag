How To Contribute
=================

Frag accepts contributions from anyone, as long as you follow the guidelines below.


Features
--------

We won't accept features which radically deviate from the key goals of Frag. For example, don't try to get typographic styles added to the core – you can build your own library for that :)


Refactoring/Rewriting
---------------------

We will accept refactors where it makes an improvement to the maintainability of the code-base or makes code more readable/understandable. If there's an argument about what's readable or not, chat about it in a pull-request.

We won't accept full rewrites unless it's actually justifiable. Your time's probably best spent on your own projects if you're attempting to rewrite this one ;)


Coding Guidelines
-----------------

  * No trailing whitespace please
  * Generally follow the style that is currently present in the code – consistency is important
  * Test changes in all supported browsers (see readme)
  * Add examples to `test/frag.html` when new functionality is added, to allow others to quickly test your styles
  * Keep indentation consistent (Sass: two spaces; LESS/HTML: four spaces)
