    Frag is a fluid, responsive, simple grid system for CSS. Frag is easy to use
    and highly configurable, you can use it with either plain CSS or Sass.

    <h2>Why Frag?</h2>

    <p>
        Frag aims to provide you with a simple grid system, nothing more. I built
        frag originally because there were not many responsive frameworks out there
        which did exactly as I wanted them to â€“ old IE support and no extra cruft. I
        talk a little <a href="http://rowanmanning.com/posts/why-another-css-grid/">more about Frag in this post</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Frag is also <a href="/docs/config/">completely configurable</a> to the
        point where you could use Frag's mixins to build your own completely
        new grid. I wanted something more like this to allow for extra flexibility;
        I don't want to tie you into my chosen widths and column counts.
    </p>

    <p>
        Frag 1.0 supported LESS as well as Sass, and handled things a little
        differently. The <a href="/1.x/">Frag 1.0 site is still available here</a>.</p>
