* [Installing and using Frag][frag-install]
* [Configuring Frag, and customising to suit your needs][frag-config]
* [Grid usage documentation][frag-docs]
* [Frag grid demo][frag-demo]


Development
-----------

In order to build CSS from the Frag source files, you'll need to install [Node.js][node] and then [Grunt][grunt] globally with `npm install -g grunt`.

Once you're set up, you can run the following commands:

```sh
$ grunt sass   # Compile CSS files from Sass source
$ grunt watch  # Watch Sass files for changes and compile them
```

Work on files in the `lib` directory; files in `build` are generated by the build tools. Please run `grunt sass` and commit generated files before opening a pull request.


Legacy
------

Frag 1.0 supported LESS as well as Sass, and handled things a little differently. The [Frag 1.0 source is still available here][1x].
