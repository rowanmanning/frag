Frag
====

Frag is a fluid, responsive, friendly, simple grid system for
CSS written in LESS.


Building Frag
-------------

In order to compile the Frag LESS source into CSS, you'll need to
install the Node.js, npm and the LESS command line utility if you
haven't already:

    npm install -g less

Then you can run the following from within the project directory
to compile the CSS:

    lessc lib/frag.less > build/frag.css
